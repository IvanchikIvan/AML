# AML - Application Memory Controller

**AML** (Application Memory Controller) is a utility designed to limit the memory usage of a specified process on Windows. This tool is useful for managing and controlling memory usage of applications to ensure that they do not exceed a specified limit.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface.
- Written in C++ for performance and efficiency.

## Usage

To use AML, open a command prompt and run the following command:

```Usage: AML.exe <process_name> <memory_limit_MB>```

### Example

```AML.exe Telegram.exe 1000```

In this example, the memory usage of `Telegram.exe` is limited to 1000 megabytes.

2. Extract the contents of the archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt in the directory where `AML.exe` is located.

## TODO

- **Linux Version**: Develop a version of AML for Linux operating systems.
